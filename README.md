We provide several tools for projecting component weights *sWeights* in a control variable(s) using a discriminating variable(s). What we call *sWeights* is the traditional *sPlot* method (we think that sPlot is a misnomer and hence call it sWeights), but also the new Custom Orthogonal Weight functions (COWs). If you use this package, please cite our methods as:

We also provide tools for correcting the covariance matrix of fits to weighted data, described in section IV of our paper and in more detail in [Langenbruch, arXiv:1911.01303](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01303).
