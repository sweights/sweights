**sweights** is a package which can implement various different methods for projecting out a particular component in a control variable based on the distribution in a discriminating variable. It is based on the work described in `H. Dembinski, M. Kenzie, C. Langenbruch, M. Schmelling, NIMA 1040 (2022) 167270 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.04574>`_.

For a basic tour of what the package does then see the tutorial_ and have a look at the  :ref:`api`. Alternatively you can browse the :ref:`genindex`.

If you are used to using `RooFit <https://root.cern/manual/roofit/>`_ and already have your fit setup this way then we also provide a wrapper to convert a RooFit pdf into the format expected here, see converter_.

The intention is to eventually port this package to `Scikit-HEP <https://scikit-hep.org>`_.
