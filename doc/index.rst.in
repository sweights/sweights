For a basic tour of what the package does have a look at the :ref:`tutorials` and at the  :ref:`reference`. Alternatively you can browse the :ref:`genindex`.

If you are using RooFit_ to fit the component PDFs, you can still use this package after converting them, see converter_.

The intention is to eventually include this package in Scikit-HEP_.
